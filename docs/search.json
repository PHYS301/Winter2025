Check units and use some logical reasoning to defend your answer (or explain why it’s wrong). Some methods you could use for the reasoning includes making predictions and seeing if your result matches those predictions, relating the answer to something you know (e.g. plugging in specific numbers and checking if they match real-world scenarios), and evaluating the equation (check limits and special cases, make sure it does what you expect)\n\n\n\nPhysics Concepts\n\nKinematicsForcesCollisions and InteractionsEnergyRotation\n\n\nPosition, velocity, and acceleration and the time derivatives/integrals that relate them\nSpecial types of kinematics:\n\nExpressing position, velocity, and acceleration in polar coordinates\nConstant speed, fixed length, and constant acceleration motion\n\n\n\nNewton’s first law and inertial frames\nNewton’s second law and relating forces to motion\nNewton’s third law and force-related interactions between objects\nIn addition, we have seen the following forces:\n\nGravity (on a planet)\nUniversal Gravitation (Gravity in space)\nTension\nPush and pull forces\nNormal force\nStatic friction (three cases: definitely not moving, maybe going to move, on the verge of moving)\nKinetic friction\nVelocity-dependent forces (drag, etc)\nSpring force\n\n\n\nImpulse and change in momentum\nConservation of linear momentum\nCollisions\n\nElastic\nInelastic\nPerfectly inelastic (stick together)\nExplosion (reverse perfectly inelastic)\n\n\n\nWork and kinetic energy\nWork done by conservative v. nonconservative forces\nPotential energy\nConservation of mechanical energy\n\n\nAngular momentum of a particle\nAngular momentum of an extended object\nTorque and Newton’s 2nd Law for Rotation\nRotational kinetic energy\nConservation of angular momentum\n\n\n\n\n\nMath Tools\n\nApproximationsCurvilinear Coordinate SystemsIntegrals\n\n\nUsing Taylor/MacLauren series when dealing with something small\nList of common series\n\n\nWorking in polar coordinates, including:\n\nTime derivatives of vectors in polar coordinates\nTime dependence of unit vectors in polar coordinates\nTranslating between Cartesian and polar coordinates\n\n\n\nSeparating and integrating simple ODEs\nCommon integrals and derivatives",

It will help me to support you in this class and will only take a few minutes of your time!\n\n\nRead the syllabus\nI’ve tried to make the syllabus relatively short, sweet, and well-organized. It’s all on this website, so please take a minute to read the syllabus page.\n\n\nKeep an eye on the schedule\nThe schedule for this class is in a google doc so that it can be updated as needed. Sometimes, things happen. Those things might be snow days, illnesses, travel, or just needing more time than anticipated on a topic. If needed, I may move due dates or adjust readings or topics in the schedule. I will talk about these changes in the classroom, but if you ever need to check a due date, the schedule will have the most up-to-date information.\n\n\nStill have questions?\nIf you’ve read the syllabus and still have questions, check out the FAQ. If you have a question that’s not answered on that page, please feel free to email me! I’ve tried to collect the kinds of questions I get the most to save you time, but I know that not all questions can be answered with this website and am always happy to hear from you.\n\n\nHave concerns?\nI know it can be intimidating to talk to a professor about sensitive topics.

What this means is that you must give a good-faith attempt at the problem, but do not need to get it correct. If you turn nothing in, or turn in something that is incomplete or unrelated, you will get no credit for the PCQ.\n\n\nUnit tests, individual final portfolio problems, and the two problem projects will be graded on the following scale:\n\nE: excellent – this is a thorough and correct answer that demonstrates excellent understanding of the concepts and makes proper use of the mathematical skills expected in this class.\nM: meets expectations – this is an answer that demonstrates solid understanding of the concepts but perhaps includes some small mathematical errors or minor conceptual mistakes.\nU: unsatisfactory / does not meet expectations – this is an answer that applies the concepts incorrectly, misunderstands the point of the question, does not complete the question, fails to follow directions, and/or contains significant mathematical errors\nN: no submission – if you turn nothing in, you will receive an N.\n\nE and M are considered passing grades. To get an A or B in this class, you must achieve some Es (see the grading scheme)\nU and N are considered failing grades.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading bundles\n\nPCQsWHWsFinal PortfolioUnit testsProblem Projects\n\n\nIn order to get the most out of class, you need to prepare. To do this, most days we will have a pre-class question due in Lyceum, which you must submit prior to class start. These are graded on completion, which simply means that you demonstrate a good-faith effort to solve the problem. You do not have to get it right, and we will go over the problem during class.\nGiven the purpose of the PCQs, I will not offer extensions, except in case of a major medical or family emergency that causes you to miss class.\n\n\nRegular problem-solving is very important to developing confidence and skill in this content, so every week you will have a short weekly problem set. You will turn in the weekly problem set by scanning and uploading as a PDF to Moodle. These are due by 8PM each Wednesday.\n5% of each homework is a reflection question, which means that simply responding to it will earn you the points, and each homework is graded out of 100 points. To pass this bundle (which is required to pass the class), you must earn 60% of all the available homework points throughout the semester. In general, the majority of questions will be on material covered on or before the Friday before the WHW is due, but there may be a question on material covered the Monday before the WHW is due. This means you should be able to complete most of the homework before Monday’s class!\nYou may work with classmates on the homework, but please be sure to give credit in your reflection question.\nYou may request extensions on the WHWs using the extension form.\n\n\nThe idea for this final portfolio assignment is to demonstrate what you have learned in the course and to create something for which you can take ownership and feel proud. We will get a lot of practice with problem solving this semester, and this is a chance to go back and curate some of what you have done.\nThe intended audience for this assignment is a fellow student who had not previously seen the homework questions you have chosen, but is curious to know how to solve them. For example, you could imagine yourself at the beginning of the semester, or a classmate earlier this semester who was unsure how to approach a problem. Would that intended audience be able to understand your approach and your logic? Would they feel empowered to learn based on what you have created for them?\nThe assignment will involve redoing 8 homework questions (one from each homework assignment) in a manner that clearly presents the logic and reasoning behind your answers. It will be useful to restate the problem in your own words, clearly identifying known and unknown quantities. In many cases, it will be useful to draw a picture of the situation and to establish a clear coordinate system. You will then want to describe and demonstrate your approach to solving the problem. Once you arrive at an answer, it will also be helpful to reflect on the implications of that answer. This could include a consideration of how the answer depends on certain variables, or how the answer might be different for a slightly different situation.\nEach problem is graded on an E/M/U/N scale, and an E and M are both considered passing grades.\nYou may request an extension on the final portfolio using the extension form. Please note, however, that deadline cannot be extended beyond the end of final exam period.\n\n\nThere will be three unit tests during class throughout this semester. The tests are cumulative, but they will largely focus on the more recent material. These tests will occur in class, and you may bring a single-sided 8.5”x11” sheet of paper with equations and notes - hand-written (please speak to me if you need to type the sheet and we will come up with a plan). This paper will be turned in with your test.\nThese are graded on an E/M/U/N scale, and you may retake each unit test up to two times during the scheduled make-up test days. In order to retake a unit test, you must first correct your first unit test and complete a short reflection in a Google form.\n\n\nThe student becomes the teacher… you will have two opportunities to write a physics problem similar to your homework problems. You must:\n\nselect at least one concept each from two different concept groups\nselect one mathematical tool to highlight\nwrite a physics problem that tests understanding of those concepts and uses the math tool\nwrite up a detailed solution to that problem using the four-step problem solving method\nexplain how your problem tests understanding for the concepts you selected\n\nThese are graded on an E/M/U/N scale, and you may use each problem project score to replace one of the following:\n\nyour WHW score for the semester (an M or higher gives you full credit)\nyour PCQ score for the semester (an M or higher gives you full credit)\none unit test score\none final portfolio problem\n\nI will always replace the grade item that most benefits you, and will never replace a better score with a worse one. The Problem Projects can only help you.\nIf you want to get a B in the class, you have to at least try a problem project, but you do not have to pass. To get an A in the class, you have to pass at least one problem project.\nIf you do two problem projects, they must be different problems (you can’t revise your first problem to get credit for the second problem.)\nYou may request extensions on the problem projects using the extension form. Please note, however, that the final problem project cannot be extended beyond the end of final exam period.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading boosts\n\nEffort BoostProblem-Solver BoostGrowth BoostMetacognition Boost\n\n\nIf you complete 85% of pre-class questions, turn in every WHW assignment, turn in a complete portfolio, and attempt at least one problem project, you will gain a grade round up for effort, regardless of the outcome of your work.\n\n\nIf you earn at least 90% of the available homework points, you will gain a grade round up for demonstrating strong, consistent problem-solving skills.\n\n\nIf you demonstrate consistent improvement in your work across the semester, I reserve the right to round your grade up.\n\n\nIn order to get this boost, you must do all of the following:\n\nFill out the mid-semester survey before class on 10/25\nAttend the SASC workshop during class on 10/25\nAttend at least one SASC Physics 211 help session and fill out a response about your experience\nSet a SMART goal (this will be evaluated on whether it meets the criteria) for a study skill to improve. You must do this before November 15.\nReflect on your goal at the end of the semester",

Please feel free to reach out to me directly if you are struggling to meet a deadline. I want to support you and make sure you have the best possible chance for success in this class, and the only way I can help is if you communicate with me.\nIn general, I am happy to be flexible. Please note, however, that some assignments will have stricter deadlines. These assignments include the PCQs and the final portfolio and final problem project, and the nature of the deadlines is discussed in their descriptions above.",
